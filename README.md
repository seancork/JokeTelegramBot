# JavaTelegramJokeBot
This bot will return a joke when the bot is messaged with the keyword joke.

# Setup
You will need to install the telegram app and message the bot called the BotFather with the command /newbot and follow the 
instructions from the bot to get a username and token to use this bot.

After the above is done, you can import this as an existing maven project in Eclipse(or whatever IDE you use) and add your username and token and run main.java.
